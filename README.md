# Advanced Quantitative Methods for Linguistic Data: An e-book

 This e-book is a study guide on quantitative methods for linguistic data, beyond the (2025) standard of frequentist linear and logistic (mixed-effects) regression modeling. Each chapter assumes that you have done readings indicated at the beginning of the chapter, each of which corresponds roughly to a week of a semester-long course (see “Context”).

The compiled version is in `_book/` and hosted [here](https://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~morgan/adv-quant-methods/).  To download a local version, download this repository and open `index.html` in the `_book/` folder in your browser.

This repository exists primarily to assign the e-book a DOI.
